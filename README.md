Proficient in web development with frameworks like Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, and VueJS
Familiar with cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud
Actively contributing to the AWS Cloud Clubs at my university

<h3>⛹🏼‍♂️ Beyond coding:</h3>

Created a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) system with features like real-time GPS tracking (2020-2022)
Mentored new interns at Briq.mx, a real estate crowdfunding platform (current)
