I'm currently a student at the University of Monterrey pursuing a degree in Engineering/Computer Technologies (Fall 2024). Currently working @Briq.mx. While I'm passionate about software development, I also have a wide range of interests outside of tech, including:

<ul>
  <li>Art & Design</li>
  <li>Video Games</li>
  <li>Fitness & Health</li>
  <li>Cinema & Film</li>
</ul>

<h3>💻 My coding journey so far:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Experienced in various programming languages (Java, C++, Python, Ruby, etc.)</li>
  <li>Proficient in web development with frameworks like Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, and VueJS</li>
  <li>Familiar with cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud</li>
  <li>Actively contributing to the AWS Cloud Clubs at my university</li>
</ul>


<h3>⛹🏼‍♂️ Beyond coding:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I seek to find ways to help other through technology.</li>
  <li>Love to implement my other interests in the stuff I create.</li>
</ul>


<h3>🔭 Looking for:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Collaborations on challenging projects that push my limits</li>
  <li>Opportunities to grow both my technical and creative skills</li>
</ul>
