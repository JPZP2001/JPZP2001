Art & Design
Video Games
Fitness & Health
Cinema & Film

<h3>My coding journey so far:</h3>

Experienced in various programming languages (Java, C++, Python, Ruby, etc.)
Proficient in web development with frameworks like Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, and VueJS
Familiar with cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud
Actively contributing to the AWS Cloud Clubs at my university

<h3>Beyond coding:</h3>

Led a team to develop a web application for a civil association focused on women's safety (2023-2024)
Created a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) system with features like real-time GPS tracking (2020-2022)
Mentored new interns at Briq.mx, a real estate crowdfunding platform (current)

<h3>Looking for:</h3>

Collaborations on challenging projects that push my limits
